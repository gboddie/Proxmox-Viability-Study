# Proxmox-Viability-Study

As part of this project, I conducted an in-depth exploration of Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE) to assess its suitability for deploying and managing virtual machines in a scalable, efficient manner. Key achievements include:

Configured Proxmox to deploy Ubuntu, Red Hat, Windows 11, and Windows Server VMs using Terraform.

Automated VM provisioning with pre-installed local databases (MySQL and MSSQL), enabling self-contained environments tailored to class-specific requirements.

Transitioned from manual post-deployment configurations to a streamlined Packer-based workflow, creating "golden images" for consistent and efficient VM cloning.

Leveraged Ansible to configure Windows VMs post-creation, demonstrating seamless integration of multiple automation tools.

This study underscores Proxmoxâ€™s capabilities as a robust virtualization platform, highlighting its potential for managing diverse IT environments with a high degree of automation.
